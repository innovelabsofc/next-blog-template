-> Pages -- Home and blog in root. Also blog/[blog]
-> blog has list of blog posts with title,published date, tags
-> each blog post has : title, tags, author, date published

for blog page, I need the title, pubished date, tags and slug
I need to get this all during ssg

In individual blog post, I can use getpaths and get stat props

blog post page:

main
blog head section
bread crumbs

common message section -  buy me coffee maybe
/main
/container


needs meta decription in contentful and dynamically add it in each blog page
